## Scope of the Perfect Square Expression

The perfect square expression used in this game, `2b - a + 2 = c`,where `a,b and c`are consecutive perfect squares, was developed by me and inspired by the need to find an elegant and efficient way to explore the world of perfect squares. By leveraging this expression, we can unlock the relationship between consecutive perfect squares and make it easier for users to learn and apply quantitative reasoning.
